# Fine_Tuning_Pipeline_for_LLM
Hereâ€™s a **much smaller and cleaner README** version that still communicates everything you asked for: generalizability, Qwen 3.0.6B, Unsloth, and Ollama export.

## Fine-Tuning Pipeline for Local LLMs (Qwen 3, Unsloth, PEFT)

This is a general-purpose fine-tuning pipeline for **small open-source LLMs** like [Qwen 3 0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B), using [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) with **QLoRA-style 4-bit quantization** and **LoRA (PEFT)** adapters.

### What it Does

* Fine-tunes LLMs on any custom dataset (`input-output` JSON or text format).
* Optimized for **low-resource** machines using 4-bit precision and PEFT.
* Trains using Hugging Face `datasets` + `SFTTrainer` with custom prompt formatting.
* Saves the model in **GGUF format** for local inference via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), `llama.cpp`, or offline apps.

### Dataset

We used a synthetic AI-generated JSON dataset (e.g., product extraction tasks), but this pipeline can be adapted to **any domain** (e.g., medical, legal, chatbots) by modifying the formatting function.

```json
{
  "input": "Extract info from: <div>...</div>",
  "output": { "name": "...", "price": "..." }
}
```

### How to Use

* Install: `pip install unsloth peft trl datasets accelerate bitsandbytes`
* Format your dataset into instruction-style strings
* Plug into the trainer and run fine-tuning
* Export to GGUF:

  ```python
  model.save_pretrained_gguf("gguf_model", tokenizer, quantization_method="q4_k_m")
  ```

> Currently set up for Qwen 3 0.6B, but works with any Unsloth-supported model (LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma, etc.) with minor tweaks.

Let me know if you'd like a `requirements.txt` or sample `train.py` to include as well.
